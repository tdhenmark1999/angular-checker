# Angular Exam

Build an Angular CRUD App for the exam to consume Rest APIs, display, modify & search data.

Checker Application in that:
- Each data has id, title, description, published status.
- We can create, retrieve, update, delete Checkers.
- There is a Search bar for finding Checkers by post id.

1. Run npm install

2. Run `ng serve --port 8081` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
